    ~~~~~
    
    PV forecast provides a set of functions to forecast the energy generation of photovoltaic system.
    To improve the prediction performance, the recursive optimization of hourly efficiency values may be used.
    It utilizes the independent pvlib-python toolbox, originally developed in MATLAB at Sandia National Laboratories,
    and can be found on GitHub "https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python".
