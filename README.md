This python-based software tool was developed in order to use the hourly weather prediction data from CoSSMic's weather data provider [Deutscher Wetterdienst](http://dwd.de/) (DWD) in order to predict the corresponding Photovoltaic (PV) energy from the various installations of CoSSMic users. The prediction data is updated each six-hours from DWD and is being pushed to the [CoSSMic](http://cossmic.eu/) (**Co**llaborating **S**mart **S**olar-powered **Mic**rogrids) server. 
The tool will run on Raspberry Pi, an embedded computer dedicated to each user participating in the project. The necessary tests have been performed to test the performance of the tool on the Pi.

For more details about the tool and the necessary configuration, please check the respective [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/cossmic/yieldprediction/wiki/Home) documentation. 

### How do I get set up? ###

A descriptive guideline about the [installation](https://bitbucket.org/cossmic/yieldprediction/wiki/Home#markdown-header-2-installation) and [configuration](https://bitbucket.org/cossmic/yieldprediction/wiki/Home#markdown-header-3-configuration) can be found in the wiki documentation.

The set up process of a whole houshold client system can be followed in the developer-guide [CoSSMic installation](https://bitbucket.org/cossmic/developer-guide/wiki/CoSSMic%20installation) documentation.

More information about the DWD weather prediction configuration will be added later on.
