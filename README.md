This python-based software tool was developed in order to use the hourly weather prediction data from CoSSMic's weather data provider [Deutscher Wetterdienst](http://dwd.de/) (DWD) in order to predict the corresponding Photovoltaic (PV) energy from the various installations of CoSSMic users. The prediction data is updated each six-hours from DWD and is being pushed to the [CoSSMic](http://cossmic.eu/) (**Co**llaborating **S**mart **S**olar-powered **Mic**rogrids) server. 
The tool will run on Raspberry Pi, an embedded computer dedicated to each household participating in the project. The necessary tests have been achieved to test the performance of the tool on the Pi.

For more details about the tool and the necessary configuration, please check the respective [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/cossmic/yieldprediction/wiki/Home).
