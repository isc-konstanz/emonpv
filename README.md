This repository provides a set of python functions and scripts to forecast the energy generation of photovoltaic system.
To improve the prediction performance, a recursive optimization of hourly efficiency values may be used.  
It utilizes the independent [pvlib](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python) toolbox, originally developed in MATLAB at Sandia National Laboratories,
and can be found on GitHub.

This tool was originally developed during the course of the European [CoSSMic](http://cossmic.eu/) (**Co**llaborating **S**mart **S**olar-powered **Mic**rogrids) project. The consortium addressed the coupling of solar panels with smart energy sharing solutions and storage capabilities, while researching a decentralized, agent-based model approach, to optimize the potentials to exchange energy inside small communities.

*The CoSSMic project has received funding from the European Commission under the FP7 framework.*
